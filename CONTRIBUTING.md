I cannot physically pull all mod data on my own.

Open a pull request with your mod's `items.json` from [Spire Exporter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1615557269) in the `data` folder with the id of your mod being the name of the file and make sure the file name is all lowercase.
